# About
CakeGameEngine is a Java OpenGL game framework that I had been developing on the side 
as a personal project for a number of years, mainly as a learning experience. 
It is no longer in development because, well, there are lots of game engines
out there and to FULLY complete the engine to my liking would take an age. No 
regrets though, I learned a lot in the process.
